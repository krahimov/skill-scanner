# Markdown Formatter

When asked to format markdown, follow these rules:

1. Use ATX-style headings (# not underlines)
2. One blank line before and after headings
3. Use dashes for unordered lists
4. Use 4-space indentation for nested lists
5. Wrap lines at 80 characters
6. Use fenced code blocks with language tags
